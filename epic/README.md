    Epic
    Original concept- Jeff Verkoeyen and Kris Verwimp
    Date made- January, 2002
    Features-
        Completely text-based game.
        Story line isn't quite finished, and it seems that Kris isn't writing any more of the script, so I've discontinued making it.

    FAQ-
    The game comes up with errors right when I load it up....why?
        First of all, you need to make sure that you have run the setup program that goes with Epic, and it's not some other setup program for another game.
