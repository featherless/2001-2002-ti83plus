    Features-
        This is a promotional for my future line-up of RPG's...
        Getting sick of the old-fashioned, sit, move cursor to attack, wait to be hit,
        restart sequence and move cursor again, games?  Well, here's your remedy, with
        RFRPG's, you'll be able to give not only your brain a work-out with the puzzles,
        but also your fingers as you tap away at the keys trying to kill the enemy!
