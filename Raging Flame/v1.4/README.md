        You will want to maximize your window and turn ON! word wrap to read this file correctly
                All V1.* updates are spaced off one from everything else

                             |Introduction|
                              ------------

    The year is 3042, and a powerful explosion has opened a portal from the medievil times.  
    An evil wizard and you have both been brought into this time.  You must destroy the evil wizard
    before he takes control of both worlds!

                           _________
                          |Game Play|
                           ---------

    v1.0

    To play Raging Flame, you will need to have a ti83plus, and about 8000 RAM free to run
    everything...I would have made it all so that it could be archived, but there's something wrong with
    the command line for it, when you run it on mirageOS, it just creates a RAM dump sortof thing
    sometimes...(if anyone knows the cure to this, please email me below).  To start the game, just
    highlight the FLAME program in your prgm menu, and press Enter.

     v1.1

     NOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTENOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAVE SPACE ON YOUR CALC, AND YOU HAVE MIRAGEOS (V1.1) THEN ARCHIVE THE MAIN  RAGING FLAME FILE!(FLAME) AND YOU WILL SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF SPACE WHEN THE GAME IS NOT IN USE
     ALSO, FOR QUICK INSTALLATION, JUST SEND THE GROUP FLAME.8XG STRAIGHT TO YOUR CALCULATORS MEM OR  RAM, AND THEN UNGROUP IT
     Now Raging Flame does work in MirageOs, but you will want to download v1.1 of mirage so that it  will not erase your programs...

      v1.2-1.3
      ~none~
       
       v1.4 one minor note, the game is now 20000 bites big, so you will need to archive/delete every
       program you have in RAM or it will not run Ok, it's been a while since i've updated this, but
       here it is!  The finished version of Raging Flame(Part 1), finished on October 19, 2001. I would
       like to thank all of the people who downloaded the first version of my game,(over 1500 YES!! far
       more than i expected) because if it weren't for the amount of downloads thatthe game got in the
       very first edition, I would have never kept my inspiration for the game.

       Over the past month, I(Jeff Verkoeyen) have recruited many people in the making of Raging
       Flame...when I first released v1.0, it was pretty crummy, i'll have to admit, but now that I
       learned new little tricks with programming, it is a LOT better!  I have also recruited some of my
       best friends in the making of Raging Flame, the list of my team is above, and in the credits for
       the game.  I would definitely like to thank Josh Rodasti, who has been my friend  since 6th
       grade, for the fantastic pictures he drew of my monsters.  I would also like to  thank Brent
       Ammann tremendously for the name of my game, which is one-of-a-kind, and still sounds cool!  And
       last but not least, I want to thank Brooks Butler for helping me out withthe plot for my game
       (there were a few little errors that he fixed in it). Well, that's enough thanks, now for the
       updates!

    X- You, the main character

       CORRECTION, NOW IT IS A PICTURE OF A GUY CARRYING A SWORD

    C- A treasure chest, stand on top of one to open it

    T- A tree, you can't move into these

    V- Buildings, also can't move into these

    O- Other citizens of the world

       CORRECTION, NOW THEY ARE PICTURES OF LITTLE PEOPLE
